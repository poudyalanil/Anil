        <label for="">Janga Badhur Rana</label>
        <p>

            Maharaja Jung Bahadur Rana was Prime Minister and virtual ruler of Nepal for approximately more than three decades between 1846 and 1877. He was a courageous man and was able to successfully overthrow his rivals, and subsequently
            reinforce his
            command in the administrative, judicial and civil affairs of the country. During his time he strived to maintain cordial relations with foreign nations in Europe and was known to have made trips to Britain and France. He also strived to
            bring
            reforms
            by promoting modernization, revising judicial customs and working towards the abolishment of various social evils like ‘Sati’. Approximately a decade after his term as Prime Minister of Nepal, he was made the King of the districts Kaski
            and
            Lamjung.
            During his period of service, he established and strengthened the ‘Rana Dynasty’, which continued to rule Nepal until 1951.</p>
        <p>

            Childhood & Early Life</p>
        <p>
            Jung Bahadur Rana was born Bala Narsingh Kunwar on 18 June 1816. His father, Bal Narsingh Kunwar was the personal bodyguard of King Rana Bahadur Shah, and was awarded the post of ‘Kaji’. His mother, Ganesh Kumari, was closely related to
            the
            respected
            Thapa family. The influential position of his parents allowed him to enter the royal court at a young age.</p>
        <p>

            At the age of sixteen, Jung Bahadur Rana joined the military, when Nepal was under the leadership of his maternal grandfather Bhimsen Thapa. However, with the loss of power of Bhimsen Thapa, he lost his job as well as property.</p>
        <p>

            Following this event, he went on a journey spanning north India for a few years and returned to Nepal in 1840.</p>
        <p>

            Later Life</p>
        <p>
            In 1840, upon his return to Nepal, he was made captain in artillery. The following year he was offered a post as the personal bodyguard of the King and in 1842, took up the position of Kaji in the palace.</p>
        <p>

            In 1946, he obtained control over the government after killing a usurper, Gagan Singh, who had plotted with the queen to elevate himself as Prime Minister and make the queen’s son as the King, by assassinating Jung Bahadur Rana. The plot
            was
            exposed
            and Jung Bahadur Rana exiled the King and Queen. He was then given the post of prime minister for life.</p>
        <p>

            By 1850, he had eliminated his major enemies and established control over important administrative matters. His family and close ones were appointed in pivotal positions at the royal court. Between 1850 and 1851, he visited England and
            France.
            He was
            known to have had good relations with the British throughout his life.</p>
        <p>

            Jung Bahadur Rana in an attempt to revise the old penal code, advised his officials to amend the nation’s then existing legal system into a unified body of laws that included procedures and frameworks for understanding and acting in the
            event
            of
            various civil and criminal matters. In 1854, the ‘Muluki Ain’ was completed and included matters like revenue, land, caste disputes, marriage and family law.</p>
        <p>

            He was a skillful diplomat and this helped Nepal to stay independent even while India was under the control of the British during his time. At the time of the Indian Mutiny in 1857-1858, he supported the British army with a battalion of
            Gurkha
            soldiers.</p>
        <p>

            He worked towards the modernization of the country and was highly influenced by European architecture and sense of fashion. Jung Bahadur Rana tried to bring about reform in Nepal by improving administration. He strived to abolish the
            custom of
            ‘Sati’, self-immolation of wives at the husband’s pyre.</p>
        <p>

            In 1856, a special decree granted complete authority in all judicial, administrative, civil affairs as well as foreign relations to him, as Prime minister. Additionally, he was made the King or ‘Maharaja’ of Kaski and Lamjung districts.</p>
        <p>

            In 1858, he was bestowed the honorary title ‘Rana’ by King Surendra. The prime ministers who descended from his family later added his name to theirs and his family went to be known as ‘the house of Ranas’.</p>
        <p>

            Upon being given the position of Prime Minister for life, he felt it was his duty that the state should be succeeded by an able adult and thus he created the order of succession in a way that is not passed from father to son but between
            brothers
            within the family. In the second generation it would be passed among the sons of his brothers as per the age in a similar manner.</p>
        <p>

            He remained Prime minister until 1877 and had supreme authority over all matters of the state. After his death, he was succeeded by his brother Rana Utdip Singh.</p>
        <p>

            Major Works</p>
        <p>
            Jung Bahadur Rana had made several contributions for the well-being of the nation. His most significant works include the creation of the ‘Muluki Ain’, and his efforts to bring in modernization along with improving ties with foreign
            nations
            like
            Britain.</p>
        <p>

            Awards & Achievements</p>
        <p>
            In 1851 he received the Sword of Honour from Napoleon III.</p>
        <p>

            He received the India General Service Medal in 1854.</p>
        <p>

            In 1858, he was presented with the Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB) by King George I. The same year he was awarded the Indian Mutiny Medal.</p>
        <p>

            He was given the Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Star of India in 1873, which was founded by Queen Victoria.</p>
        <p>

            In 1876, he was awarded the Prince of Wales' Medal.</p>
        <p>

            Personal Life & Legacy</p>
        <p>
            In 1853, Jung Bahadur Rana married Bada Maharani Hiranya Garva, who was the daughter of chief minister Fateh Jung Shah. They had four daughters who were married to royal princes. She also brought up Jung Bahadur Rana’s infant son Padma
            Jung,
            as the
            mother passed away during birth in 1857.</p>
        <p>

            He was known to have had at least 13 wives and numerous mistresses. Among his wives were Ganga Maharani who was a princess from Coorg, daughter of Rana Shere Shah who was called Ramri Maharani, a Magar girl named Mina Rani, and yet
            another
            wife
            called Misri Maharani.</p>
        <p>

            In 1877, he set out to hunt with three senior wives and two junior wives. However, he fell ill and died on 25th February 1877 on the banks of river Bagmati in Pattharghatta. His senior wives Bada Maharani Hiranya Garva Kumari, Antaree
            Maharani
            and
            Ramri Maharani committed Sati, while the young wives were persuaded to stay back and take care of their children.</p>
        <p>

            Trivia</p>
        <p>
            A Nepali movie titled ‘Seto Bagh’ was inspired by the life of Jung Bahadur. The movie was based on a novel of similar title by Diamond Shumsher Rana.</p>

        <h5>Manmohan Adhikari</h5>
        <p>
            Man Mohan Adhikari (9 June 1920- 26 April 1999) was the 31st Prime Minister of Nepal from 1994 to 1995, representing the Communist Party of Nepal. He was the first democratically elected Communist Party member to be the Prime Minister of
            Nepal. Born
            in Lazimpat, Kathmandu, Nepal, he spent his childhood in Biratnagar. His family was a landowner Brahmin family of Eastern Nepal. He was sent to Varanasi to study in 1938. While studying for his B.Sc. in 1942, Adhikari took part in Quit
            India
            movement
            and he was arrested by the British colonial authorities and jailed along with other politicians. After completing studies at the University of Benares (India), in 1942 he joined the independence movement in India, which earned him a
            prison
            term of 18
            months. He returned to Biratnagar and worked in chemical industry where, in March 1947, he took part in the Biratnagar jute mill strike and was arrested and taken to Kathmandu via land route along with Girija Prasad Koirala and
            Bishweshwar
            Prasad
            Koirala. He was an active member in the foundation of The Communist Party of Nepal. In 1953 he became Secretary-General of the clandestine Communist Party of Nepal (CPN), Maoist-inspired.
        </p>
        <p>

            He was a rare political figure in south Asia - a man who belonged to a vanished era of idealism, whose legacy was the Afno gaon, aafai banawo (build your own village) program, which allotted development funds directly to poor Nepalese
            villages. As
            chairman of the Nepal Communist party (United Marxist Leninist), and briefly prime minister, he dedicated five decades to the struggle against Nepal's authoritarian kingdom. In November 1994, elections were held following a dissolution
            of
            parliament.
            Despite Congress securing a higher popular vote than the UML, the latter secured 88 seats to the former's 83. Neither party was successful in forming a coalition to hold a majority of the 205 seats. After failed coalition negotiations,
            however,
            Adhikari became Prime Minister of a minority government, acquiring the support of the National Democratic Party and the Sadbhavana Party. In June 1995, the National Democratic Party and the Sadbhavana Party (who helped the UML form a
            minority
            government in November 1994) supported the Nepali Congress's call for a vote of no-confidence in Adhikari's government in a special session of the House of Representatives. Adhikari attempted to dissolve parliament and call elections in
            an
            attempt to
            replicate the circumstances under which he assumed office in 1994. But a Supreme Court challenge led by Congress saw this move deemed unconstitutional and the parliament was restored. The vote of no-confidence proceeded successfully.</p>
        <p>
            Elections in 1995 saw Adhikari's government voted out of office. Adhikari was one of the few democratically elected communist party members in the world to serve as head of the government. Born to a land-owning Brahmin family in eastern
            Nepal,
            Adhikari 'declassed' himself by marrying outside his caste and ethnic group and living on the outskirts of Kathmandu. Unlike many contemporaries, he made no effort to groom his son and daughter as successors. He lived a simple lifestyle
            and
            kept his
            family out of the public eye. Adhikari suffered from asthma for four decades and went to China for four years to seek treatment after contracting tuberculosis. On 19 April, he suffered a heart attack during an election rally in the
            village of
            Gothatar and fell into a coma. He was declared brain dead on 22 April with no hope of recovery. He died four days later. A pragmatist, his main achievement came in 1990 when he united his party with the young extremists of the
            Marxist-Leninist
            underground movement, who were preaching an armed peasant revolt. It transformed Nepal's communists at a time when communism was collapsing in the Soviet Union and eastern Europe. His harsh experience of parliamentary politics - which
            saw him
            defeated in a confidence motion while he was in hospital - did not discourage him, or diminish the regard in which he was held by ordinary Nepalese. At the time of his death, he was still campaigning hard for the current elections.</p>

            Nepal Ratna Girija Prasad Koirala (Nepali: गिरीजाप्रसाद कोइराला About this soundListen (help·info); 4 July 1924 – 20 March 2010),[1][2] affectionately known as Girija Babu[3], also known as G.P. Koirala, was a Nepalese politician. He
            headed
            the
            Nepali Congress and served as the Prime Minister of Nepal on four occasions, including from 1991 to 1994, 1998 to 1999, 2000 to 2001, and from 2006 to 2008. He was the Acting Head of State of Nepal between January 2007 and July 2008 as
            the
            country
            transitioned from a monarchy to a republic. Koirala, who was active in politics for over sixty years, was a pioneer of the Nepalese labour movement, having started the first political workers' movement on Nepalese soil, known as the
            Biratnagar
            jute
            mill strike in his hometown, Biratnagar. In 1991 he became the first democratically elected Prime Minister since 1959, when his brother B.P. Koirala and the Nepali Congress party were swept into power in the country's first democratic
            election.

            <h5>Girija Prasad Koirala in his youth</h5>
            Koirala was born in Saharsa, Bihar, British India, in 1924 into a Hill Brahmin family.[5] His father, Krishna Prasad Koirala, was a Nepali living in exile.[6] In 1952 Koirala married Sushma Koirala, headmistress at the local school for
            women
            in
            Biratnagar.[7] Their daughter Sujata Koirala was born in 1953. Sushma died in a kerosene stove explosion in 1967.[8]

            <h5>Political career</h5>
        </p>
        <p>
            Sketch portrait of Girija Prasad Koirala, Prime minister of Nepal Koirala became involved in politics in 1947, leading the Biratnagar jute mill strike[6] In 1948 Koirala founded the Nepal Mazdoor Congress, later known as the Nepal Trade
            Union
            Congress-Independent. Later, in 1952, he became the President of the Morang District Nepali Congress and held that office until he was arrested and imprisoned by King Mahendra following the 1960 royal coup.[6][9] Upon his release in
            1967,
            Koirala,
            along with other leaders and workers of the party, was exiled to India[6] until his return to Nepal in 1979. Koirala was General Secretary of the Nepali Congress Party from 1975 to 1991.[10] Koirala was actively involved in the 1990 Jana
            Andolan
            which led to the abrogation of the Panchayat rule and the introduction of multiparty politics into the country. He had signed on many treaties which are against nation.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h5>First term</h5>
            In Nepal's first multiparty democratic election in 1991, Koirala was elected as a member of parliament from the Morang-1 and Sunsari-5 constituencies. The Nepali Congress won 110 of the 205 seats in the Pratinidhi Sabha (House of
            Representatives),
            the lower house of parliament. He was subsequently elected as the leader of the Nepali Congress parliamentary party and was appointed as Prime Minister by King Birendra.[9]
        </p>
        <p>
            During his first term, the House of Representatives enacted legislation to liberalize education, media and health sectors in the country. The government also founded the Purbanchal University and the B.P. Koirala Institute of Health
            Sciences(BPKIHS)
            in the Eastern Development Region and granted licenses to the private sector to run medical and engineering colleges in various parts of the country. The government also undertook the construction of the B.P. Koirala Memorial Cancer
            Hospital
            in
            Bharatpur, Nepal with assistance from the government of China. In November 1994, he called for a dissolution of parliament and general elections after a procedural defeat on the floor of the House when 36 members of parliament (MPs) of
            his
            party went
            against a government-sponsored vote of confidence. This led to the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist)-led coalition coming to power in the elections that followed.[9]
        </p>
        <p>
            <h5>Second term</h5>
        </p>
        <p>
            Koirala took over as Prime Minister from Surya Bahadur Thapa following the collapse of the coalition government led by Thapa. Koirala first headed a Nepali Congress minority government until 25 December 1998, after which he headed a
            three-party
            coalition government with the Communist Party of Nepal (UML) and the Nepal Sadbhawana Party.[citation needed]
        </p>
        <p>
            <h5>Third term</h5>
        </p>
        <p>
            Koirala became Prime Minister in 2000 for his third term following the resignation of Krishna Prasad Bhattarai, under whose leadership the Nepali Congress Party had won the parliamentary election. The party had won claiming that Krishna
            Prasad
            Bhattarai would be the Prime Minister, but Koirala led a group of dissident MPs and forced Bhattarai to resign or face a no-confidence motion. At that time Nepal was fighting a civil war against the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist).
            Koirala
            resigned
            in July 2001[9] after which the military was mobilized in the civil war for the first time, something Koirala had unsuccessfully attempted to do while in office. He was replaced by former Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, who was
            elected by a
            majority of members of the Nepali Congress.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h5>Fourth term</h5>
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
            Koirala calls on the Indian Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh in New Delhi on June 29, 2004 After the Loktantra Andolan and the reinstatement of the Nepal House of Representatives, Pratinidhi Sabha, on 24 April 2006, Koirala was selected
            to
            become
            Prime Minister by the leaders of the Seven Party Alliance. The reinstated House of Representatives passed laws to strip the King of his powers and bring the Army under civilian control. Following the promulgation of the interim
            constitution,
            Koirala,
            as the Prime Minister, became the interim head of state of Nepal. On 1 April 2007, Koirala was re-elected as Prime Minister to head a new government composed of the SPA and the CPN (Maoist). Following the April 2008 Constituent Assembly
            election, the
            Constituent Assembly voted to declare Nepal a republic on 28 May 2008. Koirala, speaking to the Constituent Assembly shortly before the vote, said that "we have a big responsibility now"; he said that Nepal was entering a "new era" and
            that
            "the
            nation's dream has come true".[11]

        <h5>Madan Bhandari
        </h5>
        <p>Madan Bhandari is popular in Nepal for his political thoughts. Madan Kumar Bhandari was a noticeable Nepali political pioneer having a place with the CPN (UML), a popularity based socialist gathering in Nepal. Bhandari is best known for
            his
            determined position on patriotism and his ideological idea of People’s Multiparty Democracy, which pushed that communists can achieve communism or communist objectives through individuals’ command or through races.</p>
        <p>

            After the 1990’s just development in Nepal, Bhandari tested the occupant PM Krishna Prasad Bhattarai in parliamentary races from a body electorate in Kathmandu and crushed him with an avalanche triumph. After his triumph, Newsweek
            magazine
            distributed a meeting of Bhandari with the title “Nepal Where Karl Marx Lives” obviously comparing him with Karl Marx. Madan Bhandari’s wife, Bidhya Devi Bhandari, took up active politics after his death and in 2016 became the first
            female
            president
            of Nepal.</p>

            Madan Bhandari’s ancestral home in Taplejung, Nepal</p>
        <p>

            His family was engaged with rural exercises and his dad was a regarded individual of the town. Bhandari finished his essential instruction from his town school. His historical records regularly portray him as a splendid understudy with
            sharp
            memory
            control and amazing speech aptitudes.In 1967 Bhandari’s family moved from Taplejung to Itahari, Morang and Bhandari left for Mathura, India to seek after further examinations. In the wake of putting in two years in Mathura, Bhandari went
            to
            the
            Banaras Hindu University in India and graduated with a Master’s degree in writing and phonetics.</p>

            Bhandari joined socialist political development after he met Pushpa Lal Shrestha, the author of Nepal Communist Party, in 1972. He initially filled in as the Secretary of People’s Cultural Front and beginning 1975 he turned into a
            full-time
            socialist
            framework. His intrinsic progressive nature, bigotry towards treacheries and profound information of socio-political states of the nation are said to be factors that drew him towards comrade belief system. His political vocation advanced
            constantly
            and in 1978 he was a focal board of trustees individual from the Communist Party of Nepal (Marxist-Leninist).</p>
        <p>

            In 1982, Bhandari turned into the gathering’s politbureu part and in 1989 his political profession finished when he was chosen the General Secretary of the CPN ML from its fourth national congress. In 1990 majority rule government was
            reestablished
            in Nepal and Bhandari avoided his long underground political life. In 1991 two greatest socialist groups in Nepal, CPN-Marxist and CPN-ML, got joined together and Bhandari drove the gathering till his demise.</p>
        <p>

            Madan Bhandari’s most prominent political idea which has deeply affected Nepal’s comrade political belief system and general socialist development is his concept of Janatako Bahudaliye Janabad, which can be converted into English as
            individuals’
            multiparty majority rule government/republic. In his political reports Bhandari supported that, in the wake of the fall of the Soviet Union, Marxist philosophy had endured a genuine difficulty and on the off chance that it is to survive
            it
            needs a
            changed and helpful approach. He pushed his belief system of PMD as a ‘helpful utilization of Marxism’.
        </p>
        <p>

            The center embodiment of Bhandari’s People’s Multiparty Democracy is that communism or social change when all is said in done is conceivable without the utilization of unmistakable brutality like in customary comrade progressive
            developments.
            He
            pushed for a people’s quiet unrest where equity would borne out of vote, rather than slug. Other prominent purposes of his belief system are the accompanying:</p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Thoughts of govern of law, multiparty majority rules system, human rights, the right to speak freely, and a reasonable equity framework are not some portion of or don’t solely have a place with private enterprise. They are
                    accomplishments of
                    individuals’ battles and communists should save, take their possession and incorporate them to their more extensive communist plan.</li>
                <li>Like some other political gatherings, comrade parties as well, ought to get chose from individuals.</li>
                <li>Communists can join an administration or a decision framework even before a comrade insurgency, and such an open door ought to be utilized for dynamic changes and for reinforcing communist ideological base.</li>
            </ul>
            A portion of these thoughts have experienced feedback other comrade ideologues. Some have compared his belief system to eurocommunism and some have condemned that joining a legislature before a communist transformation has brought forth
            degenerate
            comrade elites in Nepal.

        <p>

            Bhandari’s view on Nepal’s national sway were viewed as extremely solid among his political partners. He straightforwardly scrutinized Indian and American obstruction in Nepal’s political undertakings and his infamous auto crash and
            resulting
            passing
            has been now and again connected with his solid remain on Nepal’s national sway.</p>
        <p>

            His association with Nepal’s government was viewed as troublesome. He straightforwardly and amusingly tested Nepal’s then lord Birendra to surrender his position of royalty and seek a political challenge in the event that he was not

            protected ruler and still intrigued by legislative issues.</p>

        <h5>Krishna Prasad Bhattarai</h5>
        <p>
            Krishna Prasad Bhattarai (Nepali: कृष्णप्रसाद भट्टराई; 13 December 1924 – 4 March 2011) also known as Kishunji was a Nepalese political leader. He was one of the main leaders involved in transitioning Nepal from an absolute monarchy to a
            democratic
            multi-party system. Bhattarai became Prime Minister of Nepal in April 1990 after a popular democratic movement referred as Jana-Andolan. Bhattarai was twice the Prime Minister of Nepal, once heading the Interim Government from 19 April
            1990 to
            26 May
            1991, and then as elected Prime Minister from 31 May 1999 to 22 March 2000. Bhattarai was the officiating President of the Nepali Congress for nearly 26 years from February 12, 1976, and was elected to the post of president of party in
            1988
            till
            1992. He participated in the democratic movement of Nepal from its inception. The Constitution of Nepal (1990) was promulgated while he was interim Prime Minister and he was credited for successfully holding the parliamentary election in
            1990,
            a
            milestone in Nepalese political history.
        </p>
        <p>
            Bhattarai had participated in a long struggle to modernize the Nepalese political system, aiming to transform a society that was isolated for centuries from the outside world. He started politics to end the 104-year-rule of the Rana
            Dynasty.
            During
            the political movement of 1950 to overthrow the Rana autocracy, initiated by the Bairgania Conference of the Nepali Congress on 26–27 September 1950 (Ashvin 10-11, 2007 BS), he was in charge of armed group Congress Mukti Sena fighting in
            Gorkha
            district. This armed struggle was initiated by the Nepali Congress, of which he was founding member. The armed revolution by the Nepali Congress was supported by King Tribhuvan, who was in exile, and by Indian and Burmese socialists. The
            armed
            revolution ultimately brought an end to the 104-year-rule of the Rana Dynasty on February 18, 1951 (Falgun 7, 2007 BS). This day is celebrated as Democracy Day and is a public holiday in Nepal. After the first parliamentary election of
            1959,
            at the
            age of 36, he became Speaker of lower house of parliament, though he was not an elected member. After the coup of 1960, Bhattarai was held without trial for eight years at the Sundarijal Military Detention Camp.[1] Bhattarai was
            nominated as
            the
            officiating President of the Nepali Congress on February 12, 1976 (Falgun 1, 2025 BS) by then party supremo Jananayak BP Koirala. He held this post for more than 25 years, during which time he was a key figure in Nepal's democratic
            movement.
            He was
            elected President of the Nepali Congress by the Eighth National Conference of the Nepali Congress, held in
        </p>
        <p>Bhattarai was the Prime Minister of the Interim Government after the 1990 People's Movement/Jana Andolan which brought democracy to the country, bringing an end to the 30-year-old Panchayati government, and to absolute monarchy in Nepal.
            Bhattarai
            transformed the country from an absolute monarchy to a multi-party democracy without any major problems. He was prime minister when the constitution (1990) of Nepal was promulgated and successfully held the first multi-party election in
            30
            years. He
            was a popular leader but lost the election by a very narrow margin. He again served as Prime Minister from May 1999 to March 2000. He also held the portfolio of foreign ministry from 1990 to 1991 and briefly during 1999 while he was
            prime
            minister.
            He was a founding member and former president of the Nepali Congress Party.[citation needed]</p>

        <h5>Sushihl Koirala</h5>

        <p>Sushil Koirala was a Nepalese politician and a former Prime Minister of Nepal. He held the office of Prime Minister from February 2014 to October 2015. His cousins who served as Prime Minister of Nepal were Girija Prasad Kirala, Matrika
            Prasad
            Koirala and Bishweshwar Prasad Koirala. One of the scions of the most notable Koirala family of Nepal, who are distinguished for their service in Nepalese political and societal sectors through generations, Sushil Koirala played an
            active role
            in
            Nepalese politics since 1954. After the royal takeover in 1960, he remained in exile for sixteen years. During his exile he stayed in India and edited his party’s publication, ‘Tarun’. He was incarcerated in Indian prisons for three
            years due
            to his
            role in the 1973 plane hijacking. He held several significant positions in the ‘Nepali Congress’ party including the General Secretary, the Vice President and finally the President of the party - a position he served till his death in
            February
            2016.</p>
        <p>

            He was a descendant of the famous Koirala family of Nepal. Three of his cousins namely Girija Prasad Koirala, Bishweshwar Prasad Koirala and Matrika Prasad Koirala too served as Prime Minister of Nepal at different points of time.</p>
        <p>

            Although Sushil Koirala had always maintained to have had an informal education, one of his sister-in-laws has informed that he attended a college in India from where he did his I.Com.</p>
        <p>

            Career</p>
        <p>
            He was motivated by the social and democratic principles of the ‘Nepali Congress’ that led him to join politics in his teens in 1954. All his three cousins namely Girija Prasad Koirala, Bishweshwar Prasad Koirala and Matrika Prasad
            Koirala
            remained
            members of the ‘Nepali Congress’ party holding high ranks in the party.</p>
        <p>

            After joining the party he got actively involved in the party’s objective of carrying out democratic elections in Nepal. In 1959, the first ever democratic election was held in Nepal that saw his cousin Bishweshwar Prasad Koirala
            becoming the
            Prime
            Minister.</p>
        <p>

            However, King Mahendra planned and executed a coup in December 1960 and expelled Bishweshwar Prasad Koirala. This incident resulted in exile of several members of the ‘Nepali Congress’ in India including Sushil Koirala.</p>
        <p>

            He became actively involved in the resistance movement against the government of the King during the 60s and 70s. During his exile in India that lasted sixteen years, he began editing the party’s periodical, ‘Tarun’, in Varanasi.</p>
        <p>

            In 1973, he was involved in hijacking of an aeroplane headed to India from Nepal. Although the operation fetched funds for the ‘Nepali Congress’, Sushil Koirala was incarcerated and he eventually spent three years in Indian jails.</p>
        <p>

            In 1979, he went back to Nepal and continued his efforts in setting up a democratic government in the country, which finally led to an agreement with the ruling monarchy in 1990. In 1991 the legislative elections were held.</p>
        <p>

            He was inducted as the ‘Central Working Committee’ member of the ‘Nepali Congress’ and eventually rose up in the party hierarchy. In 1996, he was appointed the General Secretary of the party and after two years he became the Vice
            President.</p>
        <p>

            He was named the acting President of ‘Nepali Congress’ in 2008 by his cousin, Girija Prasad Koirala, the then President of the party. Following the death of Girija Prasad Koirala in 2010, the ‘12th general convention’ of the ‘Nepali
            Congress’
            party
            elected him as President of the party, a position he held till his death.</p>
        <p>

            The ‘Nepali Congress’ party came to prominence under the leadership of Sushil Koirala and it emerged as the largest party in the 2013 Constituent Assembly elections.</p>
        <p>

            On February 10, 2014 he secured 105 votes of 194, thus defeating former Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba to become the new leader of the Nepali Congress Parliamentary party and was nominated as Prime Minister. The Nepali Congress
            Parliamentary party
            reached an agreement with the ‘Communist Party of Nepal’, and got the post of Prime Minister for him.</p>
        <p>

            His government however faced severe criticism on many fronts. The unsatisfactory response of his government to the families of sixteen Sherpas, who succumbed to an avalanche on Mount Everest in April 2014, was highly censured. This got
            aggravated
            with the poor response from the government following deaths of dozens of trekkers with hundreds stranded in a snowstorm in the Annapurna region in October that year.</p>
        <p>

            His government came under scrutiny again while facing probably its greatest challenge to tackle the devastating earthquake in Nepal that occurred on April 25, 2015, the worst catastrophe Nepal had seen in decades. The armed forces of
            Nepal
            were put
            into action and the government also sought international aid and assistance in its rescue, relief and rehabilitating operations.</p>
        <p>

            A new constitution was adopted in Nepal in September 2015 that was agreed upon by the four major political parties of the country. Following the new constitution, on October 10, 2015, Sushil Koirala had to step down as Prime Minister to
            pave
            way for
            Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli of the ‘Communist Party of Nepal’. The latter was elected as new Prime Minister of Nepal by the legislature.</p>
        <p>

            Personal Life & Legacy</p>
        <p>
            He remained unmarried throughout his life and was neither known to have any relationship with any woman. He led a very simple life and had a clear image all through his political career.</p>
        <p>

            According to an official website of the Nepal government, there was no property in the name of Sushil Koirala. He himself declared his three mobile phones to be his assets.</p>
        <p>

            He was fondly called 'Sushil daa'.</p>
        <p>

            Sushil Koiala was a heavy smoker and in 2006 became a victim of tongue cancer and in June 2014 he was diagnosed with lung cancer. On February 10, 2016, he succumbed to pneumonia in the capital city of Kathmandu, Nepal.</p>
