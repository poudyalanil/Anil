                        next to her mother, reached up and held onto the hem of her dress, and Pushpa experienced the overwhelming sense that “this girl called me up. This was not the place for her to be living.” From this moment, Pushpa began a

        <h5>Puspha Basnet</h5>
        <p>Pushpa Basnet found her inspiration early in life.  At the age of 21, while an undergraduate at St. Xavier College in Kathmandu<strong>, </strong>Pushpa visited a prison as part of her internship program. A 9-month old child, playing on
            the
            prison floor next to her mother, reached up and held onto the hem of her dress, and Pushpa experienced the overwhelming sense that “this girl called me up. This was not the place for her to be living.”  From this moment, Pushpa began a
            courageous journey to help the innocent children living behind bars in Nepal.</p>
        <p>

            <strong>Pushpa, her sister, and a few friends quickly raised enough money to start a day care program for some of the children.  Realizing this was not enough, Pushpa began to work with the incarcerated parent (primarily mothers), and
                the
                prison authorities, and gained their trust for the release of 2 children into her full time care.</strong></p>
        <p>

            From these humble beginnings, Pushpa, her ECDC team and her supporters have provided housing, food, education, clothing, and medical care, to over 140 children of incarcerated parents in Nepal.  More than this, together they have created
            a
            warm, loving family for the children in their care.</p>
        <p>

            Pushpa Basnet, called Mamu by the 40+ children currently living at the Butterfly Home, is determined to give these children their chance at a normal life, the opportunity to reach their potential.  “These children have done nothing
            wrong. They
            are simply caught in something they do not understand… they deserve a better future.”</p>
        <p>

            When a woman is incarcerated in Nepal and has no one able or willing to care for her children, she must choose between bringing her children to prison with her or sending them out to live on the streets by themselves, two unbearable
            options.</p>
        <p>

            Many mothers have chosen to keep their children with them in prison, considered ‘the lesser of the two evils. Unfortunately, children growing up in the confines of jail cells do not have access to education, proper nutrition, warm
            clothing,
            and medical care.  And sadly, these children are highly vulnerable to various forms of abuses as well as the multiple negative effects on their physical, emotional, and psychological development.</p>
        <p>

            Living out their young lives behind bars, without schooling or appropriate medical care, these children suffer.</p>

        <h5>Pasang Lahmu Sherpa</h5>
        <p> She was born into a mountaineering family and was involved in climbing from her teens.
            She had successfully climbed Mont Blanc, Cho Oyu, Mount Yalapic, Pisang Himal, and others.
            She had attempted to climb Mount Everest three times before, but did not succeed until April 22, 1993,
            when she reached the summit by the South Col via the Southeast Ridge route.</p>

        <p>The morning of April 22, 1993 was bright and clear, and remained so until Pasang reached
            the top of the 8,848 m. peak with five Sherpas, Sonam
            Tshering Sherpa, Lhakpa Norbu Sherpa, Pemba Dorje Sherpa and Dawa Tashi Sherpa.
            Meanwhile, a member of the team and five-time Everest sumitter Sherpa Sonam Tshering got seriously sick at south summit and, despite Pasang Lhamu's efforts to help, did not survive his illness. While descending from the summit, the
            weather, as
            often happens in the mountains, suddenly turned bad, causing her to lose her own life on the south summit.[2] Vladas Vitkauskas helped move her body down the mountain.</p>

        <p>For achieving what no other Nepalese woman had achieved before her, Pasang Lhamu was posthumously
            honored by her country and mountaineers all around the world in various ways.
            She was the very first woman to be decorated with the "Nepal Tara (Star)"
            by His Majesty the King. The National Youth Foundation conferred the 1993-94
            Youth Excellence Award on her. Similarly, in order to commemorate her feat,
            a life-size statue of Pasang Lhamu was erected at Bouddha, Chuchepati;
            a postage stamp was issued in her name; the Government of Nepal renamed Jasamba Himal (7,315 m)
            in the Mahalangur Range as Pasang Lhamu Peak; the Ministry of Agriculture named a special strain
            of wheat as Pasang Lhamu wheat; the Pasang Lhamu Memorial Hall was established
            in Dhulabari of Jhapa district in east Nepal; and the 117- Km Trishuli-Dunche road was named
            the Pasang Lhamu Highway.In the honour of Pasang lhamu Sherpa.</p>

        <h5>Dev Sumsher Rana</h5>

        Born as the fourth of the seventeen sons to Chief of the Army <i>Dhir</i> <i>Sumsher</i> <i>Rana</i>(younger brother of <i>Jang</i> <i>Bahadur</i> <i>Rana</i>) and <i>Rani</i> <i>Nanda</i> <i>Kumari</i>, <i>Dev</i> <i>Sumsher</i>was a
        reformist.
        The huge family was difficult for the father and <i>Sumsher</i> brothers so, <i>Dev</i> <i>Sumsher</i> was adopted by his childless uncle General <i>Krishna Bahadur Kunwar Ranaji</i>. As the adopted child of General <i>Ranaji</i>, <i>Dev</i> <i>Sumsher</i> had
        a lavish upbringing similar to that of the <i>Jung</i> and other cousins. Because of which he spent more time at <i>Thapathali Durbar</i> with the sons of <i>Jang Bahadur</i> (he was close to) and met his own siblings only during the
        occasions
        like festivals or family gatherings. He had 12 sons and 3 daughters. He was married to <i>Badamaharani Karma Kumari, Maharani Krishna Kumari </i>(daughter of king <i>Surendra</i>, which made <i>Dev Sumsher</i> the only <i>Sumsher</i> brother
        among the 17 to marry a princess from royal family of Nepal) and <i>Rani Ganesh Kumari.</i>

         

        The <i>Sumsher</i> family murdered many of their cousins, especially the sons of <i>Jang Bahadur Rana </i>and took over Nepal in a military coup d’état bringing the rule of <i>Sumsher</i> <i>Rana</i> family. They also murdered their uncle <i>Sri
            Teen Maharaja Ranodip Singh </i>and occupied the hereditary throne of Prime Minister and then, they added <i>Jang Bahadur </i>to their name. Although this entire coup was planned and executed by the <i>Sumsher </i>brothers, <i>Dev</i> <i>Sumsher </i>knew
        nothing about it because his brothers did not trust him as he had close relations with the <i>Jang </i>brothers. He was mistaken as a <i>Jang </i>brother and was almost killed the night of coup as he had slept at the residence of one of the <i>Jang </i>brothers.
        He was spared by the soldier who recognized him as a <i>Sumsher</i>. The remaining <i>Rana </i>families, apart from <i>Sumsher</i> were exiled and they took over the power of the country.

         

        On March 5, 1901, he became the Prime Minister of Nepal at the age of 37 years after he claimed his heredity from his late brother <i>Sri Teen Maharaja, </i>Prime Minister <i>Bir Sumsher Jang Bahadur Rana </i>and received the ‘<i>Laal Mohur’</i> (red
        stamp) of the then King of Nepal, King<i> Prithvi Bir Bikram Shah.</i> He kept his brother <i>Fathe Sumsher Jang Bahadur Rana </i>as <i>Hajuriya </i>General (Chief of the Prime Minister’s bodyguard) and his nephew General <i>Gehendra Sumsher
            Jang Bahadur Rana</i> in his post of spy-chief and head of police. He also appointed his brother <i>Sher Sumsher</i> as the Chief of Staff to the then King and even built a palace for him. In the year 1901 AD, he also appointed <i>Sher
            Sumsher </i>as the first director of Nepal’s first national newspaper <i>Gorkhapatra</i> which still is the government owned national daily.

        He was impressed by the ‘Universal Education’ (<i>Aksharanka</i> <i>Shiksha</i>), a plan prepared by <i>Jay Prithvi Bahadur Singh, </i>King of <i>Bajhang, </i>which was later published in <i>Gorkhapatra </i>1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> edition
        in 1901 AD. He was the kind of Prime Minister who was impressed with such works rather than empty flattery. It was during his time, that the iron ore mine was started in <i>Thosay</i> bazaar which is fifteen kilometers away in the north
        from <i>Manthali, </i>the
        headquarters of <i>Ramechhap</i> district. It was one of the Nepal’s largest iron ore and was used to manufacture weapons during the war with Tibet. He not only proclaimed ‘Universal Education’ but also began building schools, took steps to
        abolish slavery and introduced several other social welfare schemes along with making improvements to the arsenal at <i>Nakkhu</i> (south of Kathmandu). At the advice of his nephew General <i>Gehendra Sumsher</i>, he decided to establish
        parliament and built a big hall in his <i>Thapathali Durbar </i>like his uncle Prime Minister and Chief of the Army (Marshal) <i>Jang</i> <i>Bahadur</i>. He was also called ‘The Reformist’ for his works ad policies. He opened up the Durbar
        High
        School to the children of non-<i>Rana</i> clan as well and proposed a system of universal public primary education using Nepali as the language of instruction.

        He also introduced a campaign in Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Patan to fight corruption as well as introduced a cannon shot at midday to let people know the time. He organized ladies court, introduced newspaper to Nepal for the first time, made
        his <i>Sindure
            Yatra </i>royal proclamation eight times and in his short four month regime, he introduced gambling for two months along with <i>bhajan</i> from 3-5 pm and silent movies from 8-10 pm. He also wanted to send students to study in Japan,
        however,
        his short time as Prime Minister could not serve the purpose and the students were sent by the next Prime Minister, <i>Chandra Sumsher</i> in April 1902.

        He was overthrown by his brothers just after four months of his reign as the Prime Minister and was exiled to India. He was first exiled to <i>Dhankuta </i>as the governor of East Nepal which is why he is also known as <i>Dhankute Maharaj</i> but
        later, he fled to <i>Ilam</i> and <i>Darjeeling</i>. His successor <i>Chandra Sumsher</i> made special request to the British to look after <i>Dev</i> so that he would stay away from matters related to Nepal and as a result, the British
        offered
        a large plot of land in New Delhi which is now known as the Connaught Palace/Circle. However, he refused the offer saying he would rather settle in cooler hills than Delhi and built a sprawling collection of grand buildings near <i>Jharipani </i>in <i>Mussoorie</i>.
        His residence, namely Fairlawn Palace now remains in ruins, however, a part of the estate has been developed for a school and residential purpose. The palace he lived in until his death was sold by his descendants later. All his children,
        although they were allowed to come back and forth to Nepal, were with him in exile and it was only during the reign of <i>Juddha Sumsher,</i> that they were allowed to return back to Nepal. <i>Juddha Sumsher </i>was his younger brother whom <i>Dev</i> and
        his wife <i>karmakumari </i>had taken care of as a father and mother and as a tribute to her <i>Juddha Sumsher</i> built a huge statue that stands at the central zoo, even today. It is the only biggest statue of any female in the country.
        The
        descendants of <i>Dev</i> <i>Sumsher</i> can be found either in the traditional <i>Rana</i> home in <i>Thapathali, </i>Kathmandu or in <i>Nepalgunj </i>in western Nepal and <i>Dehradun</i> in India.

            NGO in the district and 68th in Nepal to be affiliated with Social Welfare Council (SWC). TSS is working only in Ramechhap, which is one of the backward among 75 districts of Nepal. On the basis of district level overall development
            indicators, Ramechhap has been ranked in 51 position among 75 district, as the least developed district. In the midst of civil war in Nepal, where widespread intimidation, coercion and human rights abuses are prevalent, Ghimire and her
            husband
            Jagdish grew this voluntary grassroots organization to over 6,000 members in 40 villages, providing basic services in preventative and reproductive health care, sustainable agriculture, water supply and income generation through rural
